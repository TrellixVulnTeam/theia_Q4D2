# theia
Planning the next-generation Floating Forests pipeline

## Etymology

Theia is the Greek goddess of sight and of the blue sky. She is the mother of the sun, the moon, and the dawn. Our hope is to use Theia to acquire satellite images and find blue skies!

## Tech

The proposed tech stack for Theia is:

* Django/GeoDjango
* Postgres
* Faktory
* gdal
* Pillow
* Docker
